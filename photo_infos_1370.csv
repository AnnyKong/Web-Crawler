Kelley, 1928","Old Stone Bridge, Battlefield of Bull Run, VA.","“We are standing in the entrance door looking westward directly down the main axis of the temple. The river and the rising sun are directly behind us.
“At our right and left, almost close enough for us to touch them, are the doorposts of the great entrance door, carved with the name of Ramses II as you see most clearly on the left. Beyond the door, the great vestibule hall expands before us. . . . It is 54x58 feet and the eight massive Osiris pillars which support the roof are 30 feet high. They represent Ramses II in the form of Osiris, with relief scenes.
“Looking through the door opposite us we see the hypostyle hall- 36 feet wide and 25 feet deep; you observe in the middle one of the hawks, such as we saw outside on the base of the fallen colossus. The door behind the hawk leads to a transverse ante-chamber, beyond which is the holy of holies. Through that last door we look into the holy place itself, and discern in the dim light the distant figures of the two of the tour gods who occupy it. These are Amon Re (the state god) on the left and Ramses II himself on the right. The two others seated are Ptah of Memphis on the left and Re Harmachis of Heliopolis on the right, but they are cut off from our view by the doorposts on either side. Thus the gods of the three great religious centres of Egypt, Thebes, Heliopolis and Memphis are here sacred in this temple in Nubia, and with them is associated the Pharaoh himself, the the lord of Nubia. . . . From the threshold on which we stand to that distant rear wall, it is 180 feet- hewn out of the solid rock.”

The river and the rising sun are directly behind us.
“At our right and left, almost close enough for us to touch them, are the doorposts of the great entrance door, carved with the name of Ramses II as you see most clearly on the left. Beyond the door, the great vestibule hall expands before us. . . . It is 54x58 feet and the eight massive Osiris pillars which support the roof are 30 feet high. They represent Ramses II in the form of Osiris, with relief scenes.
“Looking through the door opposite us we see the hypostyle hall- 36 feet wide and 25 feet deep; you observe in the middle one of the hawks, such as we saw outside on the base of the fallen colossus. The door behind the hawk leads to a transverse ante-chamber, beyond which is the holy of holies. Through that last door we look into the holy place itself, and discern in the dim light the distant figures of the two of the tour gods who occupy it. These are Amon Re (the state god) on the left and Ramses II himself on the right. The two others seated are Ptah of Memphis on the left and Re Harmachis of Heliopolis on the right, but they are cut off from our view by the doorposts on either side. Thus the gods of the three great religious centres of Egypt, Thebes, Heliopolis and Memphis are here sacred in this temple in Nubia, and with them is associated the Pharaoh himself, the the lord of Nubia. . . . From the threshold on which we stand to that distant rear wall, it is 180 feet- hewn out of the solid rock.”
